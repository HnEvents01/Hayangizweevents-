        <h2>SKHOKHO MARIKO: The Theatrical Powerhouse</h2>
        <h3>About the Artist</h3>
        <p>Skhokho  Mariko is a poet, actor, storyteller, motivational speaker, and rugby player from Thembisa Esigongweni  Section. Born and raised in this vibrant community, I have always been driven to pursue my passions. My journey in the arts began in 2019 when I was in grade 7. That's when I fell in love with poetry under the guidance of my friend Phoka De Poet and mentorship of Vusi nkwenkwezi. Acting also became a passion, and I believe it's a powerful way to share messages and inspire others.

But my greatest inspiration comes from my mother, who has been my pillar of strength throughout my life. Her resilience and love have motivated me to pursue my dreams, and I often draw from her wisdom and guidance in my craft. As a voice for the voiceless, I use writing, storytelling, and performance to express myself and uplift others. I've performed in various settings, including churches, schools, and assemblies, and I'm dedicated to honing my skills and inspiring young people.

Featured in the school of arts as one of the best actors, I am proud to be a true definition of arts. I'm excited to continue performing and sharing my talents with the world, and I am grateful for the support of my loved ones, especially my mother, who continues to inspire me every moment 

I looking forward to share my talent.I feel that's wat makes the world so great 

I performed in event like..Rise Mzansi in 2023 
And I became guest of honour by 1632 soup kitchen</p>
        <h3>Performance at The Big 5 Poetry Experience</h3>
        <p>From the moment he stepped into the spotlight, SKHOKHO SAMARIKO owned the stage. His performance was a tour de force of emotion and physicality, a dramatic monologue that left the audience spellbound. He used gestures, vocal inflections, and powerful pauses to build tension and create an unforgettable theatrical experience. It was a raw, commanding set that affirmed his reputation as one of the most dynamic performers in the game.</p>
