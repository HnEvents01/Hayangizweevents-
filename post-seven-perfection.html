      <h2>SEVEN PERFECTION: A Masterclass in Lyrical Craftsmanship</h2>
      <h3>About the Artist</h3>
      <p>Hope everyone is well 

My name is Sanele Selepe. My stage name is Seven Perfections born and raised in Ivory park extension 9. I started writing 2019 what inspired me to write is the fact that I'm not comfortable telling people my problems so I started writing. My poetry focused on people around me and the environment. I'm also a founder of 2 brands which are Seven Perfections and khululeka macala</p>
      <h3>Performance at The Big 5 Poetry Experience</h3>
      <p>Taking the stage on August 2nd, SEVEN PERFECTION delivered a performance that was nothing short of breathtaking. He demonstrated an impeccable control of rhythm and rhyme, weaving complex narratives that were both profound and accessible. His set was a standout moment of the night, with the audience captivated by his intellectual rigor and the raw honesty of his delivery. It was a powerful reminder that poetry can be both an art form and a deep, intellectual pursuit.</p>
